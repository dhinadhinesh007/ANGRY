Another keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank.
While supervised methods have some nice properties, they also require a large amount of training data.
Many documents with known keyphrases are needed.
Furthermore,the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable.
Unsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data.
It approaches the problem from a different angle.
Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases,
    the TextRank algorithm exploits the structure of the text itself.
Recall this is based on the notion of "prestige" or "recommendation" from social networks.
TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all,
    but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text.
Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages.
